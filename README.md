# Discord Bot - Flagged Image Detection.

## Overview
This Discord bot monitors messages for flagged image links and takes action against users who spam them. If a user posts multiple flagged images, their message is deleted, and they are kicked from the server. The bot also sends a webhook notification to report the incident.
